go through a fast api crash course and show demo to akash of the end product tom.  

learn how to use python modules

learn git:
	1. initiate a repo
	2. make changes to file
	3. add the changes in the git
	4. commit the changes

why fastapi uses uvicorn or any other servers?
why and when python uses async and await and how is it different from the ones in JS?

connect the app to a dummy database (postgresql, sqlite) and use orm for object updates.

define a get route /generate that takes the query parameter called domain from the url and returns a json 
https://bhnetwork.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISC/pages/1427013948/TrustMark+Architecture#API-Spec:   

in the response, there is a jwt token containing these attributes in the payload
	1. domain
	2. issued_at




rewrite the entire app with a starter fast template.

add trusted domain logic to block any requests from untrusted origins.
